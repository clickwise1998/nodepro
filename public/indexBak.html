Both the teading and the lecture are talking about wherther the Peary raeach the North Pole in 1909. The teading passage suggest that there are three reason can support he indeed reach the North Pole in 1909 but the speaker disagrees with the perspective mede in the reading.
the reading first claims that there have some equipment was found in the North Pole and this can providee that the Peary had comed  . However, it has strongly been opposed by the instrctor with a new proof. The professor says that the argue in the reading passage can not convinece . That is why the opinion of the reading is challenged havily.
fothermore, the reading conceives that  the Tom Avery was in the same condition as the Peary, even the tom spend less then 37 days they use the same kind of dogsles,so the hypothesse can be ture. On the contrary, the professor asserts that they are really in different conditon the Tom have the air plane to bring the food to him but the Peary didn\\\'t have ,which differs the reading as well.
Finally, the reading mention that the potografe can make an evedence because the shadow was coincide with the fact, while the professor in the listening maintains that the photographs can\\\'t prove the eveidence. Thus, reading passage has been contradicted again.
therefore, the speaker departs totally from opinions on the topic made in the reading.
